**Function Name:**          g2()

**Author:** George Staples

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** This function provides the boundry condition for the heatEE1D function.

**Input:** This function takes the following inputs:\
t: The time at which to calculate the boundry condition
  
**Output:** This function outputs a single value u which is the boundry condition for heatEE1D
	
**Usage/Example:**
Use a constant in this function for constant temperatures at the boundry. If a flux condition is used, it can be implimented here.

**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for g2()
```c++
double g1(double t){
    //Use constant value for dT/dt=0
    double u=100;

    return u;
}
```
